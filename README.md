### Hi, I’m Tonia 😊

I’m a Senior Bioinformatics Research Scientist at the [Bioinformatics
Core at the St. Jude Children’s Research
Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/research/departments/developmental-neurobiology/shared-resources/bioinformatic-core.html).

📊 🖇️ Support project analysis

:rocket: :construction: :construction_worker: Build and automate
computational workflows and pipelines

🧬 💪 Extensive experience with WGS/WES, sc-RNA-Seq, sc-ATAC-Seq and
sc-TCR/BCR-Seq analysis in the context of tumor evolution and
microenvironment

:bug: :construction_worker: Passionate about computation, automation and
reproducibility for scientists

#### Research

I am an evolutionary computational biologist by training with extensive
expertise in molecular evolution and phylogenetics, ecology and
biogeography in the context of species and cancer.

:memo: :rocket: “Tumor Island Biogeography” (TIB) framework: I
introduced TIB proposing that tumors are evolutionary islands and their
heterogeneity can be explored by using omics data in the clinical
setting ([Chroni,
2024](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781003307921-10/tumor-island-biogeography-antonia-chroni)
and [Chroni and Kumar, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evab276)).

:memo: :rocket: Co-developed
[PathFinder](https://github.com/SayakaMiura/PathFinder), a computational
Bayesian method that uses the clone phylogeny, their genetic
differentiation, and anatomical locations to infer cancer’s migration
history in a patient.
