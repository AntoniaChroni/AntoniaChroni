### Hi, I’m Tonia 😊

I’m a Senior Bioinformatics Research Scientist at the [Bioinformatics
Core at the St. Jude Children’s Research
Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/research/departments/developmental-neurobiology/shared-resources/bioinformatic-core.html).
We provide advanced bioinformatic services for investigators to leverage
genomics, proteomics and metabolomics (omics) data.

Other than support project analysis, I build and automate computational
workflows and pipelines. I have experience with WGS/WES, sc-RNA-Seq,
sc-ATAC-Seq and sc-TCR/BCR-Seq analysis in the context of tumor
evolution and microenvironment. I am also passionate about computation,
automation and reproducibility for scientists.

I am an evolutionary computational biologist by training with extensive
expertise in molecular evolution and phylogenetics, ecology and
biogeography in the context of species and cancer. I introduced the
“Tumor Island Biogeography”, a unique, fresh conceptual framework
proposing that tumors are evolutionary islands that their heterogeneity
can be explored by using omics data in the clinical setting ([Chroni,
2024](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781003307921-10/tumor-island-biogeography-antonia-chroni)
and [Chroni and Kumar,
2021](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.1201/9781003307921-10/tumor-island-biogeography-antonia-chroni)).
I also co-developed
[PathFinder](https://github.com/SayakaMiura/PathFinder), a computational
Bayesian method that uses the clone phylogeny, their genetic
differentiation, and anatomical locations to infer cancer’s migration
history in a patient. For more details on my research, please visit my
